A bot in dev for the ChainsawSuit Original Discord server!

# Getting Started

This guide assumes you already have Node JS installed on your machine and know how to use the command line.

- Run `npm install` to download all required packages.
- Duplicate `client_key.json.skel` and rename it to `client_key.json`.
- Add your bot's credentials to  `client_key.json`.
- Run `node dyk-bot.js` in your console. If you see "I am ready!" in your console, you are good to go!
